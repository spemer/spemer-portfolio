        h3.section__title Overview
        p.section__paragraph Insharior is a platform to share one’s interior items with low price, for early 20's in South Korea — especially for one person households and young people in South Korean society. They usually move their house within every 1 or 2 years due to their occupational and economic conditions. And those conditions make them hard to settle on one place for a long time, as a result, buying expensive interior items is luxury for them. As a designer, we wanted them to ‘share’ their unnecessary or hard-to-move interior items with low price with other users on our application — Insharior, by providing a platform for sharing their interior items with trust.

          ol
            li A sharp increase of young one-person households(early 20’s)— and their desire to decorate their own room with unique interior items getting higher day by day.
            li Increase of move due to one-person household’s economic conditions— which makes them hard to move their heavy furniture like bed or couch, or hard to collect interior items.
            li Increase of desire to self-interior between one-person households and economic weaker— even if they have to move their residence often.
        p.section__paragraph Based on those problems above, our team decided to make an application that resolves the needs by providing a platform to share one’s interior items with trust at a low price — Insharior.

        p.section__title--small From Audience
        p.section__paragraph Based on our audience above, we set 3 main concepts of Insharior. We wanted to make a platform that provides users can:
        div.section__list
          ol
            li Make a profit with their unused interior items
            li Rent a unique interior items with low price from other users
            li Integrate with other SNS application to share their interior

        p.section__title--small Platform
        p.section__paragraph Basically, Insharior is a ‘sharing economy’ application. Users of Insharior share their interior items on Insharior. We provide this platform with clean and intuitive interface and experience. Integrate it with other SNS like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter is available. We’re going to customize the user-front view, by using collected data from chat-bot and big data. Sharing economy applications like AirBnb, Uber, Lyft and SolarCity have a great ripple effects. They don’t have their own contents, only provide a platform for users, but makes world-class profits.
