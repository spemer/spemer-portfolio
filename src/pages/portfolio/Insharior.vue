        h3.section__title Overview
        p.section__paragraph Insharior is a platform to share one’s interior items with low price, for early 20's in South Korea — especially for one person households and young people in South Korean society. They usually move their house within every 1 or 2 years due to their occupational and economic conditions. And those conditions make them hard to settle on one place for a long time, as a result, buying expensive interior items is luxury for them. As a designer, we wanted them to ‘share’ their unnecessary or hard-to-move interior items with low price with other users on our application — Insharior, by providing a platform for sharing their interior items with trust.
