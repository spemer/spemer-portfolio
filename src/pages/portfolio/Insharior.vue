        h3.section__title Overview
        p.section__paragraph Insharior is a platform to share one’s interior items with low price, for early 20's in South Korea — especially for one person households and young people in South Korean society. They usually move their house within every 1 or 2 years due to their occupational and economic conditions. And those conditions make them hard to settle on one place for a long time, as a result, buying expensive interior items is luxury for them. As a designer, we wanted them to ‘share’ their unnecessary or hard-to-move interior items with low price with other users on our application — Insharior, by providing a platform for sharing their interior items with trust.

          ol
            li A sharp increase of young one-person households(early 20’s)— and their desire to decorate their own room with unique interior items getting higher day by day.
            li Increase of move due to one-person household’s economic conditions— which makes them hard to move their heavy furniture like bed or couch, or hard to collect interior items.
            li Increase of desire to self-interior between one-person households and economic weaker— even if they have to move their residence often.
        p.section__paragraph Based on those problems above, our team decided to make an application that resolves the needs by providing a platform to share one’s interior items with trust at a low price — Insharior.
