User testing is one of the best ways to prevent such unavoidable situations. By testing our prototypes for a number of different people, we can check for an unexpected part, or we can find better ways to improve our design.\n        p.section__paragraph\n          | Repeating those processes of user testing, implementation and improvement can make our design more solid and user friendly. Problems not found in the first test can be found in the second test. Even if we think that the third and fourth user tests have produced a satisfactory design for everyone, we may notice some other minor problems in the fifth test. Through these processes, we are able to complete a better, more solid and user-centered design.\n\n      div.page__section\n        h3.section__title\n          | Takeaways\n        p.section__paragraph\n          | Insharior app is a platform for early 20’s in South Korea — especially for one person households and young people in South Korean society.
